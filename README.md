# Create React App with Phaser Canvas

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It uses Phaser 3, which renders a canvas positioned to the center, with a max width of 960 pixels.

An on resize IIFE is used to throttle the onresize listener.

The Phaser Scene is managed with React life cycles.
